### Notes

**Nested Routes**

by creating nested folders 

e.g. 

  /projects/tada 
  
  /projects/mada


**Parallel Routes**

- used for complex layout design
- done by something called *slots*
- `@folder` is the naming convention for slots
- import the slots as props in layout
- code is more manageable
- benefits
  - independed route handling 
  - sub-navigation
